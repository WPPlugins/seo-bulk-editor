== Description ==
Increase your efficiency in managing SEO Titles and Meta Descriptions with SEO Bulk Editor for All-In-One SEO Pack.

Without SEO Bulk Editor, you need to dig through every post to determine which ones have appropriate titles and descriptions and which ones need updating. This might not seem like a major issue if you've been keeping up on your onsite optimization efforts by creating custom-crafted title tags and meta descriptions on your site. This plugin comes in very handy when performing an SEO website audit or keyword research. 

Are you redesigning or developing your website? Do you need to produce an inventory of your title tags and meta descriptions? With SEO Extended, you get two new WordPress admin pages: one that lists out every post's title and SEO Title and provides a quick way to update one or many titles, and one that lists out the lists out every post's meta description and provides an easy way to update one or many meta descriptions.
